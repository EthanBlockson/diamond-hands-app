# Fees

Fees showed as nearly equal, because calculated based on 1 token price, to not refretch it every time on input because of real price difference because of liquidity.

But when user actually calls deposit, we calculate final fees, calling getTokenPriceV2() to provide enough ether to payable function as fee.
